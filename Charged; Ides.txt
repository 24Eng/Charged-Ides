Charged: Ides

Chapter 1

"It's not safe to use your real name anymore."

"You expect me to pick some super-hero name? Like what? Fantasmo Woman? Ultramazing Girl?"

"Sure, any of those are great," I said, "if you're a stripper."

"What do you call a girl who breaks everything?" She picked an empty soda can from the grass. We watched as the paint turned black then blistered. The tab dulled and fell away followed by the lid. Finally, it fractured at her fingers like a frozen soap bubble. “Destructo Lass? I kind of like that.”

I snorted under a laugh. “Very golden era sounding.”

“I don’t want anything like your name,” she said with finger quotes. “No offense, bro.”

“What’s wrong with it?” I asked. Elizabeth, Lizzy, Liz, my sister always said “No offense” when she said something offensive, or “I don’t want to alarm anyone,” when she wanted to freak people out.

“Nothing, but it doesn’t make any sense.” She picked a stick off the ground. “It’s like a race horse’s name or some weird billionaire's yacht.”

“So, there’s nothing,” I said around finger quotes, “wrong with it, but you hate it, and it doesn’t make sense.”

“Forget it.” She threw the stick over her should and walked to my car.

I rolled my eyes and went to the driver door. The car was locked, and the keys bulged in my jean pocket.

“Open the door, Dawson, or should I call you DesertIrish from now—”

“DON’T.” I slammed the roof of the car with the keys in my fist. “You can do what you want. You don’t have to have a name. I just think that it’s…”

“What?” she crossed her arms. "Afraid everyone is going to hear your code name?" Liz swept her arm behind her. The closest people was a little girl on a jungle gym.

“I get paranoid wh—”

“Yeah, I know,” she interrupted. She was staring at the deep scratches in the car’s otherwise perfect roof.

Lizzy lifted her shoulders and dropped them. “It's just …  my friends don't even know.” With a little energy, I made the scratches in the car’s paint disappear. The roof was perfect again. Lizzy watched but kept her arms crossed.

Liz rolled her head back. “So. If people don’t know about it then why do we need fake names?”

I didn't want to lift that fleece, but it was a good question. “Fair enough. I won't bug you again.”

She nodded, and her arms fell to her sides. 

“Maybe it’s just my thing,” I said.

“You and probably every comic book nerd. So, how did you get better?”

She meant my ability to do things like repair the paint on the car roof.

“Practice. Work.” I smiled. "Calories."

"Yeah, pudgy," she called me.

Liz and I could both fit on a folding chair. Our mom was slender, and her mom may have been a broom handle.

"I have an idea." Liz dropped her elbow down hard on the rearview mirror. I heard it snap. With another hard jab, it came off and hit the ground then glass particles chimed on the blacktop.

“Ahhh, fuckin’ aa!” She rubbed her elbow. “Got anything to repair my elbow?” she asked.

“Ask Charley when we get home.” Charley was our younger brother. He could fix people the way I restored cars.

“Yeah. He kind of lucked out there, didn’t he?” Liz said.

“Depends on how you look at it," I said.

“Yeah.” Charley could undo people's injuries, but they lost their memories too.

I walked around the car and picked up the rearview mirror. No one but my sister was watching. With some energy, I felt the mirror lose weight and disappear. It reappeared on my car with an unbroken mirror but still hanging at an angle. With a bit more effort, it righted itself and looked like it just rolled off the sales lot. After driving it for a year, it had ninety-nine miles on the odometer. If this car had memory, it would have forgotten about my sister's assault.

Lizzy said, “So I’ve got the opposite of that.” She picked up another stick, and it turned to brittle kindling in her hand. “Can you fix that yet?”

I picked up a scrap of bark and smears of dark powder covered my fingers. It smelled like the bottom of a refrigerator left unplugged for a month. As I held it, I felt space for energy so I pushed and it got heavier as the wood reformed in my hand and the dark dust disappeared from my fingertips. More and more power went in, but leaves wouldn’t regrow. “See,” I held the twig out to her, “I still can’t do living things. The leaves won’t regrow. This is just dead wood now. Even Charley can’t bring things back to life.”

“I think if I had powers like Charley’s,” she said, “I would go to the hospitals and cure people who were nice. You know, chat them up and see if they’re good people. Then just leave after healing them.”

“The nurses would get suspicious. Plus everyone you healed would essentially have amnesia," I said.

“Geez Dawson, I just want to help some people.”

“I know,” I said, “I know you would. I think Charley would too.”

Her eyes narrowed. “He doesn’t want to screw with people’s lives, Dawson. How would you feel if you woke up in a hospital bed, feeling dandy, and the nurses tell you that a few hours ago your legs were missing and you’d been in a coma for a week?”

“I get it," I said. "That would be weird. Don’t you think that’s better than not having legs?” I imagined a white-coated doctor tapping my leg and shaking his head. I cracked a smile.

“Yeah. What if you lost someone in an accident? What if your kid died and you didn’t even remember it? What if you woke up, feeling perfectly all right but your son was gone? Don’t you think that would cause some pretty messed up emotions?”

“Sure," I said, "but … isn't it still better than ALSO being messed up?” 

She looked at me with a cocked eyebrow.

All I could do was give a small shoulder shrug and say, “Who’s to decide what’s better? You and I can’t. Charley probably tosses every night wondering if he should be helping people at the hospital or leaving them alone.”

“I know what I would do,” Lizzy said fast.

I looked at her. “Really? I don’t think I do.”

She walked away from the car toward a baseball diamond. Maybe it was a softball field. I don’t know if there’s a difference. 

I pointed to the car and jingled my keys. "I thought we were leaving. Hello?" I followed Liz onto the grass.

When Liz got to the outfield, she sat down hard enough that she squeaked, then pulled up some grass, turned it to dust, and let it fall into the wind.

I stood so the sun wouldn’t be in her eyes. “Have you ever hit yourself with it?” I asked.

She looked up at me with her hand shading her eyes. "How do you mean?"

“Like, have you ever accidentally made some skin decompose?”

"Oh," she looked back at the ground and shook her head. 

“You don’t believe in animal testing, right?” 

She shook her head. "Eww. Don't even ask."

“Good.” I held out my left hand, palm down. “Try it on me a bit. Slowly. Be careful.”

“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Lizzy smirked. “At least not unless you piss me off.”

I snorted. “You assaulted my brand-new Lexus. I should be pissed at you. Not the other way around.” We laughed. “Seriously, do it before I chicken out. Just a little area.”

Her eyes narrowed on my palm, and she scrunched up her face. 

The back of my hand itched like it had a crust of dried glue.
