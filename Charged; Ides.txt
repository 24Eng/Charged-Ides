Charged: Ides

Chapter 01

"It's not safe to use your real name anymore."

"You expect me to pick some super-hero name? Like what? Fantasmo Woman? Ultramazing Girl?"

"Sure, any of those are great," I said, "if you're a stripper."

"What do you call a girl who breaks everything?" She picked an empty soda can from the grass. We watched as the paint turned black then blistered. The tab dulled and fell away followed by the lid. Finally, it fractured at her fingers like a frozen soap bubble. “Destructo Lass? I kind of like that.”

I snorted under a laugh. “Very golden era sounding.”

“I don’t want anything like your name,” she said with finger quotes. “No offense, bro.”

“What’s wrong with it?” I asked. Elizabeth, Lizzy, Liz, my sister always said “No offense” when she said something offensive, or “I don’t want to alarm anyone,” when she wanted to freak people out.

“Nothing, but it doesn’t make any sense.” She picked a stick off the ground. “It’s like a race horse’s name or some weird billionaire's yacht.”

“So, there’s nothing,” I said around finger quotes, “wrong with it, but you hate it, and it doesn’t make sense.”

“Forget it.” She threw the stick over her should and walked to my car.

I rolled my eyes and went to the driver door. The car was locked, and the keys bulged in my jean pocket.

“Open the door, Dawson, or should I call you DesertIrish from now—”

“DON’T.” I slammed the roof of the car with the keys in my fist. “You can do what you want. You don’t have to have a name. I just think that it’s…”

“What?” she crossed her arms. "Afraid everyone is going to hear your code name?" Liz swept her arm behind her. The closest people was a little girl on a jungle gym.

“I get paranoid wh—”

“Yeah, I know,” she interrupted. She was staring at the deep scratches in the car’s otherwise perfect roof.

Lizzy lifted her shoulders and dropped them. “It's just …  my friends don't even know.” With a little energy, I made the scratches in the car’s paint disappear. The roof was perfect again. Lizzy watched but kept her arms crossed.

Liz rolled her head back. “So. If people don’t know about it then why do we need fake names?”

I didn't want to lift that fleece, but it was a good question. “Fair enough. I won't bug you again.”

She nodded, and her arms fell to her sides. 

“Maybe it’s just my thing,” I said.

“You and probably every comic book nerd. So, how did you get better?”

She meant my ability to do things like repair the paint on the car roof.

“Practice. Work.” I smiled. "Calories."

"Yeah, pudgy," she called me.

Liz and I could both fit on a folding chair. Our mom was slender, and her mom may have been a broom handle.

"I have an idea." Liz dropped her elbow down hard on the rearview mirror. I heard it snap. With another hard jab, it came off and hit the ground then glass particles chimed on the blacktop.

“Ahhh, fuckin’ aa!” She rubbed her elbow. “Got anything to repair my elbow?” she asked.

“Ask Charley when we get home.” Charley was our younger brother. He could fix people the way I restored cars.

“Yeah. He kind of lucked out there, didn’t he?” Liz said.

“Depends on how you look at it," I said.

“Yeah.” Charley could undo people's injuries, but they lost their memories too.

I walked around the car and picked up the rearview mirror. No one but my sister was watching. With some energy, I felt the mirror lose weight and disappear. It reappeared on my car with an unbroken mirror but still hanging at an angle. With a bit more effort, it righted itself and looked like it just rolled off the sales lot. After driving it for a year, it had ninety-nine miles on the odometer. If this car had memory, it would have forgotten about my sister's assault.

Lizzy said, “So I’ve got the opposite of that.” She picked up another stick, and it turned to brittle kindling in her hand. “Can you fix that yet?”

I picked up a scrap of bark and smears of dark powder covered my fingers. It smelled like the bottom of a refrigerator left unplugged for a month. As I held it, I felt space for energy so I pushed and it got heavier as the wood reformed in my hand and the dark dust disappeared from my fingertips. More and more power went in, but leaves wouldn’t regrow. “See,” I held the twig out to her, “I still can’t do living things. The leaves won’t regrow. This is just dead wood now. Even Charley can’t bring things back to life.”

“I think if I had powers like Charley’s,” she said, “I would go to the hospitals and cure people who were nice. You know, chat them up and see if they’re good people. Then just leave after healing them.”

“The nurses would get suspicious. Plus everyone you healed would essentially have amnesia," I said.

“Geez Dawson, I just want to help some people.”

“I know,” I said, “I know you would. I think Charley would too.”

Her eyes narrowed. “He doesn’t want to screw with people’s lives, Dawson. How would you feel if you woke up in a hospital bed, feeling dandy, and the nurses tell you that a few hours ago your legs were missing and you’d been in a coma for a week?”

“I get it," I said. "That would be weird. Don’t you think that’s better than not having legs?” I imagined a white-coated doctor tapping my leg and shaking his head. I cracked a smile.

“Yeah. What if you lost someone in an accident? What if your kid died and you didn’t even remember it? What if you woke up, feeling perfectly all right but your son was gone? Don’t you think that would cause some pretty messed up emotions?”

“Sure," I said, "but … isn't it still better than ALSO being messed up?” 

She looked at me with a cocked eyebrow.

All I could do was give a small shoulder shrug and say, “Who’s to decide what’s better? You and I can’t. Charley probably tosses every night wondering if he should be helping people at the hospital or leaving them alone.”

“I know what I would do,” Lizzy said fast.

I looked at her. “Really? I don’t think I do.”

She walked away from the car toward a baseball diamond. Maybe it was a softball field. I don’t know if there’s a difference. 

I pointed to the car and jingled my keys. "I thought we were leaving. Hello?" I followed Liz onto the grass.

When Liz got to the outfield, she sat down hard enough that she squeaked, then pulled up some grass, turned it to dust, and let it fall into the wind.

I stood so the sun wouldn’t be in her eyes. “Have you ever hit yourself with it?” I asked.

She looked up at me with her hand shading her eyes. "How do you mean?"

“Like, have you ever accidentally made some skin decompose?”

"Oh," she looked back at the ground and shook her head. 

“You don’t believe in animal testing, right?” 

She shook her head. "Eww. Don't even ask."

“Good.” I held out my left hand, palm down. “Try it on me a bit. Slowly. Be careful.”

“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Lizzy smirked. “At least not unless you piss me off.”

I snorted. “You assaulted my brand-new Lexus. I should be pissed at you. Not the other way around.” We laughed. “Seriously, do it before I chicken out. Just a little area.”

Her eyes narrowed on my palm, and she scrunched up her face. 

The back of my hand itched like it had a crust of dried glue.

Chapter 02
I walked downstairs from my old bedroom. “Hey, Lizzy!” I called to the whole house. “Are we going to the park or what?”

Charley was at the bottom of the stairs. “It’s night, man.”

“Wait, what? How long was I asleep?” I checked my phone. It was eight at night.

“No, man. You and Liz already went to the park. Didn’t you read your note?”

“What note? Oh no! You mean…”

“Yeah,” Charley said to his feet.

"Thanks." I took a deep breath and walked back to my room. I could remember the park now, talking with Liz, she broke my mirror, and I fixed it. I restored the roof of my brand-new, two-year-old car. Liz was ripping up grass when I said she could test on me.

Beside my bed was a folded piece of notebook paper with my name on the outside. In my handwriting, I described everything I remembered from the park. "Liz put some energy into the back of my left hand it got itchy right away. Then it stopped itching except at the corners because it lost feeling. All the nerves must have been fried. It looked like a bruise at first, now it is just gray and kind of cold. The edges still itch. I passed out at the park because it got pretty intense and Liz drove me home. Charley said he would help. Remember to thank him. There are pictures in my phone."

I still owed Charley a real apology. Nothing was wrong with me, but my internal clock said it was two in the afternoon, not seven at night. Five hours were gone forever. I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight. This happened every time, but this must have been better than whatever happened I saw in my hand. I slowly ran fingertips over the backs of both my hands. Two. Perfectly normal. Hands. There was a little flaky patch on the backside of the left one, but it could have been my imagination.

I found the pictures of my hand taken in the passenger seat. There was a round gray patch, yellow at the outsides, from my thumb to pinkie finger. A bubble formed in my stomach and it turned a few times. That was my body. That was not cool.

Charley walked into my room. “Are you all right?”

I swallowed and handed him my phone. “Yeah. Could you delete those pictures? I don’t want them anymore. No wonder.”

“No wonder?” he asked.

“No wonder I asked you to back that stuff off of me.”

“No problem.” Charley handed my phone back. “There you go.”

“Thanks, man,” I said. "I always appreciate it."

He shrugged and tipped his head then cracked a smile. “I wish I could do what you do.” His eyes went to his feet.

“Fix, cars? You wish you could spend your days sitting in old beaters?”

He looked up. “Yeah, that too. You take care of Lizzy and me. And dad too.” Yeah, our dad.

“You’d do the same. For the family I mean.”

He nodded. “I would.”

Charley could make me smile no matter what. “Hey,” I said, “maaaaaybe you could get a job at the pound,” I said sarcastically, “and turn old, sick dogs into puppies so other people can adopt them.” He laughed with me.

“Orrrrrrr, you could get a job repairing watches and, here it comes,” he leaned in, “turn back time.”

“Ohhh, pun, triple point score!” I thought a second, “You could keep models looking young, forever, and then just keep giving them the same paycheck over and over until you fill a whole year’s worth of a magazine.”

Charley wrinkled his brow. “That barely makes sense.”

“It makes sense," I laughed. “So anyway, I was thinking of a street name for you. What about The Catcher?” I waited for his reaction. “Like The Catcher in the Rye.”

“Firstly Dawson, that’s a gay thing, which fine, whatever. Secondly, have you read that book? Because I haven’t.” His went back to his feet.

“No, I haven’t read it either,” I said. "He sounded cool."

He smiled a bit and looked up, “But it’s got a lot of mythology attached to it.”

“Oh, like what?” I asked.

He sighed, “I don’t know. It’s a pretty famous book.”

“Yeah, there’s that. I’ll keep thinking.” I didn’t know what else to say. At least Charley was on board with having a street name.

He looked around my room. “What were you thinking for dinner?”

It still felt like early afternoon to me, and I wasn’t ready for dinner. “Oh, um. I’m not feeling it. Just wanna order everyone a couple pizzas?”

“Sure.” Charley went to find Lizzy and have her call Gary’s Pizza with the order, then answer the door for him. He left the room with a twenty-dollar bill and two fives.

There were grass clippings on my pants from the park I didn’t remember visiting. They went in the hamper, and I put on a fresh pair. Downstairs, Liz and Charley were watching a reality show about the mundane lives of Hollywood stunt doubles. Who wants to hear about a stuntman who also loves to prune bonsai trees?

“Hey?” Lizzy said, but she wouldn't look at me. “How ya doing?” She smiled with her mouth but not her eyes. 

I smiled, and her eyes met mine. “Just peachy. It’s not the right time of day though. Did you order breadsticks? I guess I am kind of hungry.”

Charley shook his head.

Lizzy said, “No. Didn’t know you wanted any.”

I shrugged. “No biggie. Do we still have cold cuts?”

“You can have some of my pizza,” Charley said.

“What did you get?” I asked on my way to the kitchen.

“Sausage and pineapple.” Lizzy rolled her eyes. Those were dad’s favorite toppings.

The fridge had a few slices of deli meat and some cheese. I called over the door, “I might have a slice or two.”

“OK, cool,” Charley shouted back.

I started a sandwich with some rye bread I bought yesterday. It was the first time anyone else in the house had seen an unsliced loaf of bread. Our bread knife was used for the first time. The mustard was due for a bar mitzvah pretty soon but a little energy and it smelled all right.

This house used to have worn out shingles, a crooked chimney, three cracked windows, blue siding that looked more like dirt than the sky, squeaky floors and stairs, stained carpet, sunburnt walls and a front door that got lower to the ground as you got further from the hinges. Now all those things were “good as new.” Everything in the house looked like it was still under warranty. The acid green toaster, a relic from a different decade I had never seen, made toast like a champ now and the color was already retro. If it weren’t for the fabric coated wire, it could have come from the store this morning. The matching refrigerator used to keep me awake as a kid, but now I could sleep next to it. I felt a little homesick now that everything worked.

Was a twenty-year-old guy supposed to stare at the kitchen wall and think about the past?

The doorbell rang and I heard bare feet walk to the door on smooth, level hardwood floors.

When I was ten, the dishwasher wasn’t even plugged in. It just held some pots and pans that didn’t fit in the cupboard. Now it washed dishes.

I wrote “sammich stuff” on the shopping list and sat on the couch with everyone. A dry red maple leaf had come in with the pizza and sat on the shoe mat by the door.

“Did you bring plates?” Lizzy asked.

“For YOUR pizza?" I wiggled into place. "No, but I have my plate right here, sissy.” I held up the uneaten sandwich.

Charley got up from a leather lounge chair that used to sport duct tape and cigarette burns, then came back with two more plates. “Smart ass,” she said to me. “Thanks, Char” she said to Charley.

They each took two slices of pizza from the box on the coffee table. This coffee table was unremarkable because it had four legs, even paint with no chips and a shiny top with zero gashes.

“What are we watching?” I asked Lizzy who had the remote.

“Something about hunting ghosts, I think.”

“Think they’re real?” I asked.

Liz laughed. “No, they’re definitely implants!” She was referring to the overweight man cohosting the show, and we all laughed. 

Ha ha. “Think I should get mine done?” I asked.

“Get an ass implant too,” she said, “for some balance of course.”

Charley piped in, “Get ‘em big enough that you can bust the buttons off your shirt. Then fix it, people will love that.”

Liz laughed the hardest at that. Charley didn’t joke much, especially in a ribald way. He used that word once, and it struck me as a very Charley thing to say.

The laughter stopped when the front door opened. Dad was home.

"Woo. Smells like pizza!” He walked into the living room and glanced at the heavy cohost on television. They shared the same body type, but dad needed a shave and haircut, and a good job. He worked a regular 8-5 at a snow plow factory, and never came home before seven. He just crashed and woke up here. Without invitation or warning, he sat down between Lizzy and I then grabbed a slice of Charley’s pizza. “My favorite, thanks, guys.”

He smelled like he drank a beer with his shirt which was missing a button. I threw a little power at it without thinking, and the button was back in place. He had already eaten to the crust of his pizza.

“What are we watching?” he said with a full mouth.

Liz said, “Nothing. Just a show about ghosts or something. It's dumb.”

Charley watched his plate instead of the television.

“Aren’t you home early?” I asked. It wasn’t two in the afternoon as I thought. I sighed at myself.

“Nah, I’m not picking up hours at the shop anymore, so I only worked ‘til five.” He helped himself to another slice of Charley’s pizza. “Where are the pepper sprinkles?”

“I threw them out a few weeks ago,” Liz said. “They were old as hell. Do you want a plate or something?”

“I’ll put peppers on the shopping list,” Charley said.

"Ready for that plate?" Liz asked again. "You're making a huge fucking mess."

“You guys don’t know what you’re missing. Hot peppers with sweet pineapple is a fantastic combination. You mind doing the shopping tomorrow?” dad said and elbowed me hard enough to slide my sandwich across the plate. He wouldn't get paid until the end of the month.

“I shouldn’t drive a lot. I don’t have insurance on the car. I don’t need it, per say.”

“That’s bologna.” Even when he was drunk, he wasn’t a vulgar man. He spoke well of women, and he didn’t swear. “What if you get pulled over, they’ll ticket you for sure. Cops in this town aren’t forgiving, and you look like a college brat so they won’t be gentle. You get my drift, right?” He elbowed me again and I squeezed my sandwich from the top. Now it had a thumbprint but no nibbles.

My dad lugged snow plows across a factory floor all day. He was stronger than he knew. 

“I’ll call the insurance company in a bit,” I said.

“Kiddo, they’re closed.”

I sighed at myself again, and I caught Charley smirking at my mistake. “I mean in the morning.”

“Good, go through my company. Those insurance companies on TV with stupid gimmicks aren’t worth jack. Get insurance from someone you can see. Not a lizard.” He elbowed my sister, “Right, Lizzy?”

“Ugh, dad! Knock it off. That hurts. I’m going to my room.” She tossed her plate on top of a pizza box and walked off with both.

Dad watched Liz go. “Well, excuse me.” He rolled his eyes, took another piece of pizza and tried to watch a commercial about a local magic show tomorrow at Riverfront Park.

I managed two bites of my sandwich and set the plate down. “Which insurance company do you use?”

“American Time. ‘Merican." Hehe. His eyes were only half open.

“I’ll call…in the morning.” He had a point about getting pulled over. If I was in an accident, I could fix the cars myself and pretend there was no harm. If I got pulled over, I’d be looking at a ticket and a fine.

“Atta boy. What’s with this guy?” He pointed at the fat cohost, “He an expert or something?”

“He’s a national ghost hunter and a professor at a college in Maine,” Charley said.

“That’s just ridiculous. If I found out I was in a class taught by someone who hunted ghosts I’d walk right out.” Dad gulped a pizza crust and leaned back on the couch.

Charley put his plate down. “He works at a paranormal research college actually.”

“Uh huh. Ever seen a ghost?” dad asked.

Charley and I shook our heads.

“When I was younger, before I had you guys, I saw a family of ghosts. My buddy, Joey, and I were fishing off his parent’s dock. It was pretty late, and we snuck a few beers because it was the cabin. Everyone drinks at Joey’s. So, we were putting bait on by moonlight and casting into a nice little patch of weeds. I remember we caught more little perch that night than anything I’d ever seen. Anyway, Joey drops a beer in the lake. It’s not open, so we both get on our hands and knees to fish it out of the lake, but something’s not right.” He paused. “But the reflection in the water wasn’t Joey and me, it was this old family, like a mom and a dad and two kids. They were wearing nice old clothes, and she had an old sun umbrella. They weren’t haunting or anything, just looking like they were having a day out at the lake. They didn’t look ghostly. In fact, they were full color. Swear to heaven. Joey saw the same thing. We watched for a solid five minutes. Weren’t scared or anything. They never looked at their reflection or us.”

I thought he was telling the truth. Who knows if that wasn’t a time abnormality caused by someone else with powers. Maybe someone was playing a trick with time and space. Perhaps he was a dumb drunk teenager.

Dad started to nod off. I grabbed my plate and put it in the dishwasher. Charley did the same and put the last slice of pizza in foil with most of my sandwich. “What do you think?” Charley asked. “About the story.”

I shrugged my shoulders. “It might be true. Powers?”

He grunted. “Could be. Who knows.”

“I probably shouldn’t drive you two to school. No insurance and all.”

“Oh, all right. That’s fine.”

We heard dad peel himself off the couch and heard his work boots go up the stairs for his nightly shower. Lizzy shut her bedroom door which was next to the bathroom.

“Wanna play some Call of Duty?”

I smiled. “Let’s do this, bro. Waaait, do you have any homework?”

“Probably.”

I stood with my feet together.

“Yeah. Writing and geometry. After that?”

“Sure thing. I’ll warm up a controller in the meantime. I could use the practice.”

He smiled. “You’ll need it.” He went upstairs and I went into the living room.

The dishwasher would run for about an hour, and that should drown out the game.

Charley finished his homework and proved that I still needed more practice. He mopped the floor with me.

Liz came downstairs and said something about how we shouldn’t play all night.

Dad came downstairs in a threadbare robe. “Mind if I cut in?”

He didn't smell like a bar, and he had shaved. “Sure,” I handed him, my controller. His robe was older than me. Quite a lot of energy went into turning back the clock on that ratty old thing. “Knock it off,” he said when he realized what I was doing. “Don’t bother with this old thing.”

“It looks good,” Charley said. “Better anyway.”

Dad smacked his lips. “Are there any cold cuts left?”

“No, I finished them off. I’ll pick more up tomorrow when I’m shopping.”

He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Just as well. My bed is calling anyway.” He got up off the couch. “Don’t keep Charley up all night. He’s got school.”

I nodded.

“Can you give Liz a ride to work tomorrow? I’m planning to go out with the boys, so I need the truck.”

“Sure,” I said. “No problem.” Lizzy was a part-time waitress at a family restaurant called Westerly’s.

I took the controller back. “Warn me when it’s ten, man,” I said to Charley, “It feels like it’s barely dinner time to me.” I was going to be up all night. Fixing the robe tired me out a little but not enough to knock me out.

When Charley went to bed, I searched online for car insurance. I didn’t want to walk into an insurance agent’s office without any idea of what to expect. Plus, there were terms like liability, uninsured motorist coverage and principal driver. The monthly premiums were all over the board. Liz had her license and Charley had a learner’s permit. They would be getting pulled over sooner or later. Dad was probably right about the insurance.

I still wasn’t tired so I walked around the house on my tiptoes. In the basement, under the stairs, was a Rubbermaid container of old photos. Inside that was a jewelry box. My mom’s old jewelry box. There wasn’t any jewelry in it. Ever. She didn’t wear jewelry. Now it held all the pictures of her that my dad had ever taken. She looked the same in all the pictures. It was no secret from us that our mom didn’t age. We inherited our secrets from her.

There was a wedding photo with a younger version of dad. Pictures of her in the hospital, there different times with there different newborns. There was a picture of her holding a pineapple with a paper umbrella and a straw coming out of it. She held her hand under it like it was for sale. The latest was her cutting a cake at my tenth birthday party. The oldest was her sitting on a dock with her feet in the water and the date was five years before I was born. 

I was getting close to the age mom, looked in the pictures, and I would look older than her someday. Some of the photos were yellowing so I turned them back, and the colors were all fresh. They didn’t take much energy. Tomorrow, I would buy a film scanner and make digital copies of all these. 

When it felt like bedtime, everyone else has been asleep for hours. I set my alarm for seven on my phone. It was Friday now, probably a good day to look for a wrecked car. I would need some more cash soon and restoring a car would sap enough energy to put my sleep schedule back on track.

While I was lying in bed, I thought about the first car I restored here. At the time it seemed logical to restore a ‘69 Ford Mustang Boss 429 I found in the paper for a few hundred dollars. The seller lived on a farm, and it was just something his kid bought with the intention of restoring, but he never had the time or money. He said that it was not a car people would pay big money for, so restoring it wouldn’t be profitable. It was drivable, so I brought it to the house. The Mustang sat on the curb in the rain for a week while I cleared room in the garage.

It took another week for me to put enough energy into the car to bring it back from the dead. I didn’t drive it during that week. She and I just sat in the garage. It took a lot out of me, and I was always tired and hungry that week. She grew younger while I grew exhausted. When I finally opened the garage door and started her, it sounded like an orchestra of thunder. She didn’t have insurance, but I peeled around town in that muscle car all day. The first place we went was McDonald’s because I was starving. When I went through the drive-thru, I had to turn off the engine to hear the speaker.

That week I brought her to a classic car show. One guy, Clyde, asked too many questions about the motor and specific parts he pointed to under the hood, but I had no idea how to answer. I’m not a gearhead. While he grilled me with questions, I thought maybe I should be restoring antiques instead. People probably wouldn’t ask so many questions. When Clyde asked if he could drive it around the parking lot, I tossed him the keys.

When he came back, he looked at me funny but offered me a smile and a beer even though I was seventeen and looked fifteen. He showed me his old Camaro and his ’69 Corvette then introduced me to his wife. She held a plastic cup with red fingernails the same color as the Camaro and the cup. Clyde told her about my Mustang, and she started in with the questions too. He shook his head at her.

That was my last car show.

Now, I restored cars less than five years old. They had high resale value, and people didn’t ask about engine displacement. Whatever that was.

I said a quick prayer for what I might find at the junk yards tomorrow. Maybe I would find a Lexus or one of the new Buicks. Something recently totaled in an accident was good for the money.
